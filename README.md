# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

This is where all my basic C# projects will be!
* These are some small C# programs I made to learn the basic functionality of the language along with the .NET Framework. They are from exercises I did at The Tech Academy bootcamp. They are nameed after the concept that was used in the code.

* Car Insurance


# Car Insurance 

 This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on bussiness logic. There is also an admin page 
that allows staff to  view all of the quotes that have been issued. This Car Insurance also has an Admin,
Insurree and a Home page.
