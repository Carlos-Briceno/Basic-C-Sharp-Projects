This is where all my basic C# projects will be!

* Car Insurance


# Car Insurance 

 This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on bussiness logic. There is also an admin page 
that allows staff to  view all of the quotes that have been issued.
